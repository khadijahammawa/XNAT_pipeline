from unittest.mock import patch

# In this example, we're using the patch function from the unittest.mock library to replace 
# the input and subprocess.run functions used in the download_toni.sh script with mock versions.
# We're also using the pytest.fixture decorator to define a fixture called 
# rootdir that returns the path to a test root directory.
# The first test function, test_download_toni_success, tests that the script successfully 
# downloads a participant folder from the TONI server when provided with a valid USERID. 
# We're using the patch function to simulate user input and the subprocess.run function, and then capturing 
# the output to check that the expected message is present in the stdout.
# The second test function, test_download_toni_failure, tests that the script fails 
# gracefully when it's unable to connect to the TONI server. We're using the same patch function to simulate user input and 
# subprocess.run, but setting the return code of the mock_run object to 1 to simulate a failure. 
# We're then checking that the script returns a non-zero exit code and outputs an appropriate error message to stderr.
# You could run these tests using the pytest command in the same directory as your tests. 
# Let me know if this helps, or if you have any questions or concerns.
